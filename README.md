The **WHO** guideline recommends adults and children *reduce their daily intake of free sugars ~ 25 g (6 tsps) per day*

This includes: 
- glucose and dextrose, fructose, household sugar (sucrose)
- malt sugar (maltose) and also sugars that are found in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates. 
- Free sugars are either added to the food by the consumers themselves (e.g. sugar in coffee, honey in muesli, â€¦), but they are also found in many processed foods (e.g. ready meals, soft drinks, cookies) and in the catering sector (e.g. sugar in desserts)




### Excluded drinks
- McDonalds smoothies are excluded, as their serving size is in grams.
